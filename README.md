# **Spam SMS Filtering System**

## **Introduction:**
This project is done as part of the Novoic Machine Learning challenge, here the task is to classify the given SMS messages as Spam and Ham(legitimate).

## **Dataset Description:**
The data comprises 5,574 SMS messages. Each message is labelled as either 'ham' (legitimate) or spam.

Each line in data.txt corresponds to one message. The first word is the data label (either ham or spam), followed by a tab (\t) character and then the message.

## **Approach:**

Since this is an open-ended challenge, we are welcomed to use our creativity in analyzing data. The project comprises of following activities.
* Binary Classification.
* Data exploration and visualization.
* Unsupervised Clustering.



## **Binary Classification:**

Firstly the label count is checked and it is known that there are a total of 4827 Ham and 747 Spam messages are there in the dataset which is an imbalanced dataset. Therefore in order to split the dataset into training and test dataset stratified train test split method is used which helps 


For this task, I performed all preprocessing tasks with related to text data such as removing punctuation,
